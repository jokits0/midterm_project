                </p>
                <p>
                    Vegetable and Fruit gardening has now become increasingly prevalent as a recreation and a source of nourishment. Establishing a seed or transplant and watching it grow to fullness brings us joy. In addition, vegetable and fruit gardening is a great way to get some exercise while also providing healthy snacks and food for the table. So, we build the company not just for our benefits and also for the benefits of our co-workers.

                    Harvesting
                </p>
                <p>
                    Harvesting is the simplest step in the process of completing our product's business. We gather a variety of fruits and vegetables in large quantities. The majority of the veggies and fruits were ripe and nice, and these will be the ones we sell in our business. The bad fruits and vegetables will be discarded, while some of the good ones will be sold to business partners for use in canned goods.

                <p>
                    Our top considerations in packaging are product safe, our customer’s experience, and customer’s budget. There are different kinds of packaging we offer. First, the <strong>Paper Bag</strong> the cheapest of them all we can provide safety but not the all-time of this packaging. Second is the <strong>Eco-Bag</strong> safety will be acknowledged in this packaging but also it is the most expensive. Last packaging is the <strong>BOXING</strong>, this was the safest and second cheapest from the three packaging. We reused boxes on packaging the product for product safe, our customers experience, and customers budget.
