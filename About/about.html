                <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; color: rgb(153, 153, 153); font-size:1.5rem">Founder</p>
                <p>I graduated with the degree of Bachelor in Computer Science at a young age. After graduating, I enter the world of entrepreneurship, it has always been at the heart of my business journey.  At the age of 18, I delved into the world of foods and became a nutrition entrepreneurship.  This was my first company purchase, and it led to many more over the years. I had never worked for anyone but myself in my 5 years of business.  I have substantially benefited from learning by doing rather than reading about it.</p>
